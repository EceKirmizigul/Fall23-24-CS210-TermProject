# Spotify & Apple Health Step Count Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project is conducted as part of the SabancÄ± University - CS210 Introduction to Data Science course. It aims to examine the relationship between music listening habits and physical activity by analyzing two personalized datasets:

1. **Spotify Listening Data for One Year**  
2. **Apple Health Step Count Data for One Year**

## Project Motivation
As someone who values both music and maintaining an active lifestyle, I am intrigued by the potential connection between my activity levels (specifically step count) and music preferences. This project seeks to identify whether variations in daily step counts influence the type or duration of music I listen to, or vice versa. By examining these datasets, I aim to uncover patterns that reveal how physical activity and listening behavior intersect, providing deeper insights into my personal habits.

## Data Sources
- **Spotify Data:** Includes a full year of personal music listening history, downloaded via Spotify's data export feature.  
- **Apple Health Data:** Daily step count records for one year, retrieved from Apple Health using iPhone's data export tools.

## What is Contained in the Datasets?

### Spotify Data
- **Coverage Period:** Data spanning one year.
- **How to get ?:** Spotify gives the data. 
- **Included Features:**
  - List of songs played, along with the artist details
  - Duration of listening sessions
  - Timestamp for each song played

### Apple Health Step Count Data
- **Coverage Period:** One year of daily records.
- **How to get ?:** The Apple Health gives .xml files of personal data, which are converted to .csv format for easier analysis.
- **Included Features:**
  - Date of activity
  - Total number of steps recorded each day
  - High-level trends in physical activity (optional for analysis)

## Future Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Study daily step count trends to identify active and less active periods.
   - Investigate Spotify usage patterns, listening durations.
   - Generate visual representations to highlight key observations in both datasets.

2. **Correlation Studies:**
   - Analyze how variations in daily step counts might correspond to changes in listening habits.
   - Explore the relationship between high activity days and listening habits.

3. **Machine Learning Implementation:**
   - Develop clustering models to categorize music preferences based on activity levels.
    
4. **Insights and Reporting:**
   - Summarize the results in a clear and comprehensive report.
   - Include interactive graphs and charts to visualize the findings effectively.

5. **Repository Maintenance:**
   - Continuously update the repository with scripts, visualizations, and progress documentation.


## Summary of the Project

That part is added after all things done in project and is summary of the project to be visible in readme file. Please refer to the Project report for better understanding of the project.

This project, conducted as part of the Introduction to Data Science course, provided an opportunity to apply data science tools and methods to real-world personalized datasets. The goal was to examine potential relationships between physical activity (step counts) and music listening habits (Spotify listening minutes). 

By integrating data visualization, statistical tests (e.g., Pearson correlation, t-tests, chi-square tests), and machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest), the project revealed a weak but statistically significant negative correlation between step count and listening minutes. While this relationship was minimal, the project highlighted the complexity of human behavior and the need for multidimensional approaches to fully understand such interactions.

In addition to the analysis, the project involved comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), merging and preprocessing datasets, and generating actionable insights. This hands-on experience in data science aligns well with principles of Industrial Engineering, particularly in optimizing systems and understanding interconnected variables.
